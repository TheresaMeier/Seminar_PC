# Seminar_PC
This repository contains code and results of numerical experiments on the PC algorithm and several extensions.

In folder [**01_Code**](https://github.com/TheresaMeier/Seminar_PC/tree/master/01_Code) codes of the simulation study and its visualization are provided. 
Since all data is simulated within 
the file *Simulation_Study.R*, 
no specific data is required ro run the code. The results (goodness of fit and required run time) are stored in tables which can be found in 
[**02_Tables**](https://github.com/TheresaMeier/Seminar_PC/tree/master/02_Tables). The corresponding plots are in folder [**03_Plots**](https://github.com/TheresaMeier/Seminar_PC/tree/master/03_Plots).

For the application to a real data set, the parallel PC-algorithm gets applied to weather time series data. The respective plots are stored in folder [**04_Climex**](https://github.com/TheresaMeier/Seminar_PC/tree/master/04_Climex).

Finally, folder [**05_Submissions**](https://github.com/TheresaMeier/Seminar_PC/tree/master/05_Submissions) consists of both the slides from the oral presentation and the report.
